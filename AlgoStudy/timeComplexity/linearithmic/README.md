N*log(n) --> linear O(n) + logarithmic log(n)

Linearithmic time complexity it’s slightly slower than a linear algorithm
it’s still much better than a quadratic algorithm

The entire input must be iterated through, and this must occur O(log(n)) times
n items iterated log(n) times gives O(n log(n)).

No comparison sort can operate faster than this
