O(n!) - Factorial time --> Permutations

Factorial is the multiplication of all positive integer numbers less than itself. For instance:

5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

You want to stay away if possible from algorithms that have this running time

Examples of O(n!) factorial runtime algorithms:
    Permutations of a string.
    Solving the traveling salesman problem with a brute-force search
