O(2^n) - Exponential time --> SEQUENCE

Exponential (base 2) running time means that the calculations performed by an algorithm double every time as the input grows.

Examples of exponential runtime algorithms:
    Power Set: finding all the subsets on a set.
    Fibonacci.
    Travelling salesman problem using dyanmic programming.
