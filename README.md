Name	        Insert	    Access	Search	Delete	    Comments
Array	        O(n)	      O(1)	  O(n)	  O(n)	      Insertion to the end is O(1). 
HashMap	      O(1)	      O(1)	  O(1)	  O(1)	      Rehashing might affect insertion time. 
Map (BST)	    O(log(n))	  -	      O(log(n))O(log(n))	Implemented using Binary Search Tree
Set (HM)	    O(1)	      -	      O(1)	  O(1)	      Set using a HashMap implementation. 
Set (List)	  O(n)	      -	      O(n)	  O(n)	      Implemented using Binary Search Tree
Set (BST)	    O(log(n))	  -	      O(log(n))O(log(n))	Implemented using Binary Search Tree
LS (singly)	  O(n)	      -	      O(n)	  O(n)	      Adding/Removing to the start of the list is O(1). 
LS (doubly)	  O(n)	      -	      O(n)	  O(n)	      Adding/Deleting from the beginning/end is O(1). But, deleting/adding from the middle is O(n).
Stack (array)	O(1)	      -	      -	      O(1)	      Insert/delete is last-in, first-out (LIFO)
Queue (na√Øve)	O(1)	      -	      -	      O(n)        Remove (Array.shift) is O(n)
Queue (array	O(1)	      -	      -	      O(1)        Worst time insert is O(n). However amortized is O(1)
Queue (list)	O(1)	      -	      -	      O(1)	      Using Doubly Linked List with reference to the last element.
